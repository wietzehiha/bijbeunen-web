INTRODUCTION
------------

This very simple module allows users to log in with either their username OR
email address from the same input box on the standard login form.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

Core dependencies only.


RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------

This module duplicates some functionality present in the 7.x-1.x versions of
the logintoboggon module.
However, at the time of writing that module does not have a functional 8.x-1.x
version.
